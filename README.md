# CSV_lib

The project is a CSV manipulation library written in C++. It is built with a codeblocks project, so you need this particular IDE if you want to add elements to the library 
(under it present form). The goal of this library is to provide a simple and quick way to manipulate csv files. The code comes with a doxy documentation so the library can
be used out of the box just by downloading the bin file and reading the documentation.
